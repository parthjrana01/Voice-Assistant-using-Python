Everything you've ever wanted is on other side of fear.
If you get tired learn to rest not to quit.
You are someone's reason for happiness so please stop being sad and cheer up.
Someday everything will make perfect sense. So for now, laugh at the confusion, smile through tears, and keep reminding yourself that everything happens for a reason.
Do not stop. Just keep going my friend!
